            <ol>
                <li>Preheat oven to 250 degrees F (120 C).</li>
                <li>Mix salt, sugar, black peper, paprika, and garlic powder for dry rub inside a small bowl and set it aside.</li>
                <li>Line a large sheet pan with heavy-duty aluminum foil and place the ribs on the pan with bone side down. </li>
                <li>Poke with knife while making shallow slits across at an angle and repeat in opposite direction.</li>
                <li>Coat both sides with the dry rub prepared earlier. Flip the rib over to ensure bone side is facing downwards. Wrap <strong>tightly</strong> with tinfoil</li>
                <li>Transfer to center of preheated over and bake for 2 hours. Remove from oven and let it cool to room temperature.</li>
                <li>Refrigerate until cold and firm for at least 2 hours (or overnight).</li>
                <li>Preheat a charcoal grill until coals are very ashy and hot.</li>
                <li>Remove ribs from the refrigerator, unwrap, and brush off excess fat. Slice between the bones to separate each rib.</li>
                <li>Combine ketchup, brown sugar, soy sauce, vinegar, oil, and cayenne with a spoon in a bowl to make the glaze.</li>
                <li>Place rib in the grill and cook for 2 minutes. Flip and brush over glaze. Repeat glazing until satisified for about 10 minutes more.</li>
                <li>Remove and place on a plate. Apply one more application of glaze.</li>
